# n9-development-sources
A collection of older projects for the MeeGo / Harmattan (example Nokia N9) platform

I wanted to learn MeeGo / Harmattan development for my Nokia N9.
When I started I created the N9 Development blog on Tumblr to document my progress
and maybe inspire others to pick it up as well. Here you can find all sources
discussed in the blog.
